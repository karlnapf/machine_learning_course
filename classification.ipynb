    "Naive Bayes is one of the simplest density estimation methods from which we can form one of the standard classification methods in machine learning.\n",

    " * Very easy to program and intuitive \n",
    " * Fast to train and to use as a classifier \n",
    " * Very easy to deal with missing attributes (we did not do that here)\n",

    "if we know people are talking about politics, this\n",
